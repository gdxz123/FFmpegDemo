# FFmpegDemo

FFmpeg practice on iOS

Many of the APIs for FFmpeg tutorials on the Web have been scrapped. To facilitate new learners, the latest examples of FFmpeg 3.2 on iOS have been written.

The project completes the video file (output.mp4) to get the bitstream and decode to get the pixel frame (YUV/RGB).

Project dependency libraries: FFmpeg 3.2 CoreMedia. framework CoreGraphics. framework AudioToolbox. framework libz. TBD libz2. TBD libiconv. TBD Video Toolbox.

The project currently removes the FFmpeg 3.2 class library. Please compile and add FFmpeg3.2 to run again.
